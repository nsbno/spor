Add new Autocomplete component based on Chakra UI's official Combobox

The new Autocomplete component replaces the overly complex custom combobox implementation with a simpler, more accessible solution built on Chakra UI's well-maintained Combobox component.

**Features:**

- Supports both core and floating label variants
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Input and Field components
- Handles internal/external filtering, loading states, multiple selection, and grouped items
- Improved accessibility and universal design standards compliance
- Modern UI with refined design and animations
- Adds flip-switch support in AttachedInputs to simplify travel search implementation
