# Spor design tokens for Elm

Design tokens used for Elm applications running on vy.no.

## What is this for?

Vy is Norway's largest transportation provider. The constants defined in this package form the basis of all UI elements for the Elm applications running on vy.no.

Unless you're trying to imitate the style of vy.no or the Vy app, this package is probably not going to be that interesting.

The contents of this package has been generated based on the design token specification in [nsbno/spor](https://github.com/nsbno/spor.git).
