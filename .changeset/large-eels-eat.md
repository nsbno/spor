Button: The Button component is all new and shiny â€“ and with no breaking changes at all. However, since the implementation is completely different, you might want to double check that everything looks as it should.

A new feature is that the right icon is now always right aligned, which makes this component much more versatile than before. The variant="control" is now deprecated as well.
