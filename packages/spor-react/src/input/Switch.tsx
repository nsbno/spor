 * A switch lets you toggle between on and off, yes and no. It's an alternative to a checkbox.
 *
 * You can use a Switch component inside of a `FormControl` with an associated `FormLabel`:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <FormControl>
 *   <FormLabel>Enable alerts?</FormLabel>
 *   <Switch />
 * </FormControl>
 * ```
 *
 * Switches are available in three different sizes - `sm`, `md` and `lg`. There are also two variants - `solid` and `outline`.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <FormControl>
 *   <FormLabel>Enable alerts?</FormLabel>
 *   <Switch variant="outline" size="lg" />
 * </FormControl>
