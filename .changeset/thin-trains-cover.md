Rename stars icons from "icons" to "stars"

This is a breaking change, as it requires direct consumers to change their imports for some icons. Vhen updating to this major version, make sure to import "stars-(outline|fill)-[size].svg" instead of "iconss-(outline|fill)-[size].svg" wherever necessary.
