# The Spor Documentation website

This package contains the code for the Vy Spor documentation website.
It's based on [Remix](https://remix.run/docs), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), as well as the Spor design system itself.

## Setup

Before you start development, you need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, start the development server with `npm run dev`. The site will open on `localhost:3000`.

## New release?

Bump version in `package.json` to push it out.
